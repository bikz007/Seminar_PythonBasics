    "* Objects – 'Everything is an object in Python.'\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using objects is almost in every instance when programming with python programming language. This includes the use of integers, floats, strings etc.\n",
    "     All the objects used above have reference.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    \n",
    "* References - The variables in Python programming language are associated with references\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Fundamental Types - Python has some fundamental types - boolean, int, float, string, list, dictionary, set, tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Names have scope, objects don’t. Objects only ‘disappear’ if nothing references them. Objects are kept if references still exist to them, regardless of which scope the reference exists in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Containers hold references to objects - not the objects themselves . Containers can hold other containers . Examples of containers include **tuple, list, set, dict**; these are the built-in containers. More container types are available in the collections module.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Python has a few control structures : for, if, while\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python has functions : def <name>(<arguments>)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python has classes with inheritance and multiple inheritance: class<name>( <subclasses>)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Python has modules (source files which can be imported which then extends the functionality available to a given program), and packages (groups of modules). Modules can define variables, functions and classes in any combination.\n"
